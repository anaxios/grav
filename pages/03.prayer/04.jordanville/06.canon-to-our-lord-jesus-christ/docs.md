We bow to Thy most Holy Mother who served for the dread mystery of Thy Incarnation. We praise the Angelic Choir as the servants and singers of Thy Majesty. We beatify Saint John the Forerunner who baptized Thee, O Lord. We honour also the Prophets who announced Thee. We glorify Thy Holy Apostles. We celebrate the Martyrs. We praise Thy Priests. We venerate Thy Saints and sing to all the Just. We, Thy servants, offer to Thee, our all-generous God, this countless and unutterable Divine Choir as intercessors, and pray: Grant us the forgiveness of our sins for the sake of all Thy Saints, but especially for the sake of Thy holy generosity, for Thou art blessed for ever. Amen.
