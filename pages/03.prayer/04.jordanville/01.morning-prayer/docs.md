On rising, make the sign of the Cross and say:

In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee.

Heavenly King, Comforter, Spirit of Truth, Who art everywhere present
and fillest all things, Treasury of good gifts and Giver of Life, come
and abide in us, and cleanse us of all impurity, and save our souls, O
Good One.

Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal One, have mercyon us. (thrice)

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and
ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Most Holy Trinity, have mercy on us. O Lord, wash away our sins, O
Master, pardon our transgressions. O Holy One, visit and heal our
infirmities, for Thy Name's sake.

Lord, have mercy. (3 times.)

Glory to the Father, and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and
ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come.
Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread. And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. And
lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

For Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages of ages.
Amen.

The Troparia to the Holy Trinity

As we rise from sleep we worship Thee, O good and powerful Lord, and to
Thee we sing the Angel's hymn: Holy, Holy, Holy art Thou, O God; through
the Mother of God, have mercy on us.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.

Having raised me from bed and sleep, O Lord, enlighten my mind, and open
my heart and lips to praise Thee, O Holy Trinity: Holy, Holy, Holy art
Thou, O God; through the Mother of God, have mercy on us.

Now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Suddenly the Judge will come, and the deeds of each will be laid bare;
but at midnight let us cry with fear: Holy, Holy, Holy art Thou, O God;
through the Mother of God, have mercy on us.

Lord, have mercy. (12 times.)

Prayer of St. Basil the Great to the Most Holy Trinity

As I rise from sleep I thank Thee, O Holy Trinity, for through Thy great
goodness and patience Thou wast not angered with me, an idler and
sinner, nor hast Thou destroyed me in my sins, but hast shown Thy usual
love for men, and when I was prostrate in despair, Thou hast raised me
to keep the morning watch and glorify Thy power. And now enlighten my
mind's eye and open my mouth to study Thy words and understand Thy
commandments and do Thy will and sing to Thee in heartfelt adoration and
praise Thy Most Holy Name of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, now and ever,
and to the ages of ages. Amen.

O come let us worship God our King.

O come let us worship and fall down before Christ our King and our God.

O come let us worship and fall down before Christ Himself, our King and
our God.

Psalm 50

Have mercy on me, O God, according to Thy great mercy; and according to
the multitude of Thy compassions, blot out my transgression. Wash me
thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I realize
my iniquity, and my sin is before me continually. Against Thee only have
I sinned I and done evil in Thy sight, that Thou mayest be justified in
Thy words and win when Thou art judged. For, behold, I was conceived in
iniquities, and in sins did my mother desire me. For, lo, Thou lovest
truth; the unknown and secret things of Thy wis dom Thou hast made known
to me. Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed; Thou
shalt wash me, and I shall become whiter than snow.Thou shalt make me
hear joy and gladness; the bones that have been humbled will rejoice.
Turn Thy face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities. Create in me
a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not
away from Thy face, I and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me. Restore to
me the joy of Thy salvation, and confirm me with a princely spirit. I
shall teach Thy ways to the lawless and the godless will return to Thee.
Deliver me from blood, O God - O God of my salvation - and my tongue
shall extol Thy justice. O Lord, Thou wilt open my lips, and my mouth
shall declare Thy praise. For if Thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would
have given it; but burnt offerings do not please Thee. The sacrifice for
God is a contrite spirit; a contrite and humble heart God will not
despise. Gladden Sion, O Lord, with Thy good will; and let the walls of
Jerusalem be built. Then Thou wilt be pleased with the sacrifice of
righteousness, the oblation and burnt offerings; then they will offer
calves on Thine altar.

The Creed (Symbol of Faith)

I believe in one God, Father, Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and
of all things visible and invisible: And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the
only-begotten Son of God; begotten of the Father before all ages; Light
from Light, True God from True God, begotten, not made, of One Essence
with the Father, through Whom all things were made: Who for us men, and
for our salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy
Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became Man: And was crucified for us
under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried: And He rose on the
third day according to the Scriptures: And ascended into Heaven, and
sits at the right hand of the Father: And He is coming again with glory
to judge the living and the dead; And His Kingdom will have no end: And
in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of the Life, Who proceeds from
the Father, Who with the Father and the Son is equally worshipped and
glorified, Who spoke by the Prophets: And in One, Holy, Catholic and
Apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the remission of sins. I
look for the Resurrection of the Dead; And the life of the Age to come.
Amen.

First Prayer of St. Macarius the Great

O God, cleanse me, a sinner, for I have never done anything good in I
Thy sight; deliver me from the evil I one, and may Thy will be in me,
that I may open my unworthy mouth without condemnation, and praise Thy
holy Name of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages
of ages. Amen. Second Prayer of St. Macarius the Great Having risen from
sleep, I offer Thee, O Saviour, the midnight song, and I fall down and
cry unto Thee: grant me not to fall asleep in the death of sin, but have
compassion on me, O Thou Who wast voluntarily crucified, and hasten to
raise me who am prostrate in idleness, and save me in prayer and
intercession, and after the night's sleep, bless me with a sinless day O
Christ, our God, and save me.

Third Prayer of St. Macarius the Great

Having risen from sleep I hasten to Thee, O Lord, Lover of men, and by
Thy loving-kindness I strive to do Thy work, and I pray to Thee: help me
at all times, in everything, and deliver me from every evil thing of the
world and every attack of the devil, and lead me into Thine eternal
Kingdom. For Thou art my Creator, the Giver and Provider of everything
good, and all my hope is in Thee, and to Thee I send up glory, now and
ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Fourth Prayer of St. Macarius the Great

O Lord, Who in Thy abundant goodness and Thy great compassion hast
granted me, Thy servant, to pass the time of this night without the
temptation of any opposing evil, Lord and Creator of all, by Thy true
light and with an enlightened heart grant me to do Thy will, now and
ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Fifth Prayer of St. Macarius the Great

Almighty Lord God, Who dost receive from Thy Heavenly Powers the
thrice-holy hymn, receive also from me, Thy unworthy servant, this song
of the night, and grant me every year of my life and at every hour to
send up glory to Thee, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to
the ages of ages. Amen.
