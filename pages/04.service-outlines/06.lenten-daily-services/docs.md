- There is no rubric for Great Compline as the Liturgikon is sufficient. However, it should be noted that during Clean Week there are four gospel readings at the end of Compline:
    - Monday Luke 21: 8-36, Tuesday Matthew 6: 1-13, Wednesday Mark 11:22-26, Thursday Matthew 7:7-11
- This rubric assumes the full service is done. However, due to travel and as a concession to human weakness the service is slowly shortened throughout Lent
    - After the first week of Lent the Kathisma at the hours are omitted.
    - After the second week of Lent the third Kathisma at matins is omitted
    - Further, if there are few chanters present, or for the sake of the human weakness, the service can be further shortened. The Hours can be omitted all together (apart from the 6th hour, which because of its reading ought to be done). These omissions are made at the discretion of the protos in consultation with the protopsaltis
